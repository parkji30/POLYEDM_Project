# PolyEDM-Project
A simulation of YBOH molecules travelling through different magnetic fields. 

This Simulation Software was primarily conducted to further our understanding of different molecules when they 
travel through a molecular beam decelerator. 

The project is based off the PolyEDM collaboration (www.polyedm.com). 

The collaborating universities were Harvard, Caltech and Arizona State University.
