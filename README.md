# PolyEDM
We are building an experiment to search for the electron's electric dipole moment in laser-cooled and trapped polyatomic molecules.  These molecules offer robust systematic error rejection via internal co-magnetometer states, and provide a route to explore PeV-scale CP-violating physics.

Searches for the electron EDM depend on the ability to perform spin precession measurements with long interaction time and large numbers.  Both of these can be achieved with laser-cooled and trapped neutral polyatomic molecules, which also offer robust systematic error rejection techniques via internal co-magnetometer states.  The rapid advances in laser cooling of diatomic and polyatomic molecules have made such an experiment within reach, and will enable significant increases is sensitivity.  As an example, consider 106 heavy, eEDM-sensitive molecules in optical trap with 10 s coherence time.  After 1 week of integration, such an experiment will have sensitivity to CP-violating physics at the PeV scale.  This is beyond the reach of conceivable accelerators.  The ability to combine long coherence time, large numbers, internal co-magnetometers, and the ability to further enhance sensitivity via quantum control techniques is unique to polyatomic molecules.

# Running the Program
In the <b>Beam Slowing</b> and <b>Hamiltonian</b> folders, simply type

python3 main.py in either folder in order to calculate the magnetic field strength and hamiltonian energy levels of super cooled molecules. You should obtain the following plots as shown below.
